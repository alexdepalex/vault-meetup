# Vault
Vault is a tool for **securely** accessing secrets. A **secret** is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a **unified interface** to any secret, while providing **tight access control** and recording a detailed **audit log**.

!SUB
# Without Vault
- More and more secrets
- Secrets all over the place
- No insight who uses which secret
- No procedure in case something bad happens

!SUB
# With Vault
- Centralized source for secrets
- Unified access interface
- Pluggable backends

# Backends

!SUB
# Storage Backend
A storage backend is responsible for durable storage of encrypted data. Backends are not trusted by Vault and are only expected to provide durability. The storage backend is configured when starting the Vault server.

!SUB
# Secret Backend
A secret backend is responsible for managing secrets. Simple secret backends like the "generic" backend simply return the same secret when queried. Some backends support using policies to dynamically generate a secret each time they are queried.

!SUB
# Auth Backend
Auth backends are the components in Vault that perform authentication and are responsible for assigning identity and a set of policies to a user.

!SUB
# Audit Backend
Audit backends are the components in Vault that keep a detailed log of all requests and response to Vault.

# Launching
Use the run command of the Nomad CLI:
```
$ export NOMAD_ADDR=http://nomad-01.stack.gce.nauts.io:4646
$ nomad run helloworld-v1.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "3d823c52-929a-fa8b-c50d-1ac4d00cf6b7"
    Evaluation triggered by job "hellloworld-v1"
    Allocation "f67a-72a4-5a13" created: node "5b7c-a959-dfd9", group "hello-group"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "3d823c52-929a-fa8b-c50d-1ac4d00cf6b7" finished with status "complete"
```

<br />
You can also submit a job in JSON format to the HTTP API endpoint:
```
$ curl -X POST -d @helloworld-v1.json $NOMAD_ADDR/v1/jobs
```
doc: [/docs/http/index.html](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/http/index.html)

!SUB
# Where is our job?
```
$ curl -s $NOMAD_ADDR/v1/job/helloworld-v1/allocations | jq .
{
  ...
}
```

Search for the allocations where **.TaskStates.helloworld.State** is not "dead" and collect their **.ID**'s. For each of those .ID's:
```
$ curl -s $NOMAD_ADDR/v1/allocation/<ID> | jq .
{
  ...
}
```
Inside the **.TaskResources.helloworld** block, for each of the **.Networks**, collect the **.IP** and for each of the **.DynamicPorts**, their **.Value**.
Those are the ip's and corresponding ports for your service.

!SUB
Or you can use some JQ-fu and get it with a script:

```
#!/bin/bash
JOB=$1
TASK=$2

# This obviously only works if there is just one port exposed per task.
for ALLOC in $(curl -s "$NOMAD_ADDR/v1/job/$JOB/allocations" \
  | jq --arg TASK $TASK -r '.[] | select(.TaskStates | .[$TASK] | .State != "dead") | .ID')
do
  curl -s "$NOMAD_ADDR/v1/allocation/$ALLOC" \
    | jq --arg TASK $TASK -r '.TaskResources | .[$TASK] | .Networks[0].IP + ":" + (.Networks[0].DynamicPorts[0].Value | tostring)'
done

$ ./get_job_address.sh helloworld-v1 hello-task
10.20.30.8:42957
```

!SUB
Check that the job is running properly by calling it:
```
$ curl http://10.20.30.8:42957
Hello v1!
```

!SUB
# Constraints
By specifying constraints you can dictate a set of rules that Nomad will follow when placing your jobs. These constraints can be on **resources**, self applied **metadata** and other configured **attributes**.

```
constraint {
  attribute = "$node.datacenter"
  value = "dc1"
}
```
doc: [/docs/jobspec/index.html](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/jobspec/index.html)

<br />
- *What happens if you target a constraint that can't be met?*

!SUB
# Restarting
Very few tasks are immune to failure and the addition of **restart policies** recognizes that and allows users to rely on Nomad to keep the task running through transient failures.

```
restart {
  interval = "1m"
  attempts = 2
  delay = "15s"
  on_success = true
  mode = "delay"
}
```
doc: [/docs/jobspec/index.html](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/jobspec/index.html)

!SUB
# Scaling
Nomad can handle the scaling of your application for you, all you have to do is provide the **desired amount** of instances you want to be running.
This can only be applied on the **taskgroup** level.

```
count = 5
```
doc: [/docs/jobspec/index.html](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/jobspec/index.html)

<br />
- *What happens if you make the count larger than the number of machines?*

!SUB
# Updating
Nomad allows us to easily do **rolling updates**. Add the **update block** and change the **version** of our job, to do a rolling update.

```
job "helloworld-v2" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type = "service"

  update {
    stagger = "30s"
    max_parallel = 1
  }

  group "hello-group" {
    count = 5
    task "hello-task" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image = "eveld/helloworld:2.0.0"

# Resource management

!SUB
In order to schedule jobs on the right nodes, Nomad needs to know **which resources**
are available and **where**, and which resources a job needs. Nomad currently can manage the following resources:
- CPU cycles
- memory
- Disk space
- Disk IO
- Network ports
- Network IO

!SUB
# Available Resources
- These are resources Nomad detects at **startup time**
- Since recent versions Nomad **fingerprints periodically**
- Processes not scheduled by Nomad are **not** considered
- Currently it is **not** possible to query unallocated resources

!SUB
The "node" endpoint shows the detected resources:

```
$ curl http://localhost:4646/v1/node/0af1abf0-d55c-3923-188f-495bed729a4e | jq .Resources
{
  "CPU": 2500,
  "MemoryMB": 1704,
  "DiskMB": 7493,
  "IOPS": 0,
  "Networks": [
    {
      "Device": "eth0",
      "CIDR": "10.20.30.5/32",
      "IP": "10.20.30.5",
      "MBits": 1000,
      "ReservedPorts": null,
      "DynamicPorts": null
    }
  ]
}
```

doc: https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/http/node.html

!SUB
# Reserving Resources
Jobs can specify **which** and **how many** resources the need. Nomad the may instruct
the task driver (e.g. Docker) to not let the process use more.

For example the default a job may specify (within the "task" section):

```
resources {
  cpu = 500 # 500 Mhz
  memory = 256 # 256MB
  network {
    mbits = 10
    port "db" {
      static = 3306
    }
  }
}
```

# Decommissioning nodes
We can let Nomad move all of a node's applications by letting it drain:
```
$ nomad node-drain -enable 37b31879
```
We can then view the status of the node with the node-status command:
```
$ nomad node-status
ID        DC    Name                  Class   Drain  Status
37b31879  dc1   bbakker-farm-01-pkdh  docker  true   ready
033744da  dc1   bbakker-farm-01-umft  docker  false  down
b7d2886d  dc1   bbakker-farm-02-2ru3  docker  false  ready
2fae0a91  dc1   bbakker-farm-01-m4s0  docker  false  ready
d8211338  dc1   bbakker-farm-02-17v3  docker  false  ready

0d470098  sys1  bbakker-nomad-02      system  false  ready
```

!SUB
On each machine there is a script that is called on shutdown, which drains a node and waits until all applications are moved.
```
#!/bin/bash
NOMAD_ADDR="http://${1:-localhost}:4646"
NODE_ID=$(curl -s $NOMAD_ADDR/v1/agent/self | jq -r .stats.client.node_id)

echo enable node drain
curl -s -X POST $NOMAD_ADDR/v1/node/$NODE_ID/drain?enable=true > /dev/null

echo wait for drain of all allocations
for t in {0..59} ; do
  ALLOCS=$(curl -s $NOMAD_ADDR/v1/node/$NODE_ID/allocations \
    | jq '[.[] | select(.ClientStatus == "running")] | length')
  echo remaining allocs is $ALLOCS
  if [ "0" == "$ALLOCS" ] ; then
    echo node drain completed
    exit 0
  fi
  sleep 1
done
```

!SUB
# Preemptible instances
Since losing a machine is not critical anymore, we can take advantage of the node-drain feature to use **preemptible instances** at our cloud provider. This will call node-drain **30 seconds** before the node shuts down and **moves all the applications** to healthy nodes.
